[Winner of Hack The Dot @ Galvanize](http://www.hackthedot.org/)

All the teams are told a single premium domain name at the beginning of the event to build something for. They then have two hours to come up with a functioning site inspired by that domain. Which ever team builds the most creative and funny idea for the domain wins.
Participants will be judged on functionality, design, humor, and creative domain name interpretation.
